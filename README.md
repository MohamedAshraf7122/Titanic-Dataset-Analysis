🔑 Key Insights

Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.

First-class passengers were more likely to survive compared to other classes.

Younger passengers (children) had higher chances of survival.


🚀 Next Steps

Apply Machine Learning models to predict survival (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
